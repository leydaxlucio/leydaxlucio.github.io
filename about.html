          <!-- text -->

          <p><b>Saving Galveston Shores is a nonprofit organization whose aim is to improve the current state of Galveston Ocean.</b> There is a severe littering problem in Galveston Beach. Anything man-made – such as fishing gear, plastic bags, beverage bottles, balloons, food wrappers, and even vessels – can become marine debris through dumping, improper waste management, litter that is blown or washed out to sea through storm drains, and extreme natural events which can transport both small and large items into the ocean. 
          Marine debris can injure or kill marine and coastal wildlife; damage and degrade habitats; interfere with navigational safety; cause economic loss to fishing and maritime industries; degrade the quality of life in coastal communities; and threaten human health and safety. 
          <br> <br> 
        	 We intend to tackle this issue by informing the community and hopefully influence others to take care of their oceans. </p>

      <h3>Eniromental Impacts</h3>

      <div class="toptext">

        <p>It is no longer safe or advised to swim in the Galveston Ocean. The once-blue waters have darkened along with the reputation of Galveston Beach. As a community, we must clean the trash that overwhelms our shores. 
        <br> <br>
        The following information is provided by the United States Environmental Agency:</p>

          <p><b>When exposed to trash pollution, wildlife in aquatic and terrestrial environments face physical hazards from ingestion and entanglement.</b> The impact that trash has on wildlife depends on a diverse range of factors, including the debris size, type, shape, and quantity, the type of organism that is exposed, and the type and frequency of exposure. Animals that become entangled in debris risk suffocating or drowning. Many species mistake plastic debris for food or inadvertently ingest plastic debris while feeding or swimming. Once ingested, this debris can damage their digestive tract and interfere with an animal’s ability to feed, leading to starvation or other negative health effects. 
          <br> <br>
          Scientists have found that at least 558 species, including turtles, seabirds, and marine mammals are reported to have ingested or become entangled in plastic waste.</p>

          <p><b>Microplastics can contain or absorb toxic chemicals potentially presenting toxicological risks for organisms that ingest them.</b> Rather than biodegrading, plastic waste often breaks down into tiny pieces known as microplastics (less than 5 mm in size), which are nearly impossible to clean up once they are in the environment.  When aquatic organisms eat these plastic particles, microplastics – and the chemicals they carry – can make their way up the food chain. In fact, researchers have found microplastics in a variety of the fish and shellfish that people consume. However, continued research is needed to fully understand the chemical risks associated with exposure to plastic debris and microplastics. 
          <br> <br>
          Trash pollution can also damage habitats, but the exact impacts are highly dependent on the type of debris and the characteristics of the ecosystem that it pollutes.  For example, trash can smother aquatic plants and corals, interfering with their growth. Debris can also serve as transport for non-native species into an ecosystem.</p>
